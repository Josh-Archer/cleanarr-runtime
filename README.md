# Cleanarr

`cleanarr` is a reusable Plex cleanup runtime with two deployable harnesses:

- `job`: a scheduled cleanup worker for Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, and optional Transmission maintenance
- `webhook`: a Plex webhook receiver that can sync watch state and optionally trigger deletion logic from Plex events

This repository is public-safe by design. It contains the runtime, images, tests, and generic examples. Private cluster overlays, secrets, and rollout orchestration belong in a downstream repo.

## What It Does

Cleanarr is built for setups where Plex is the source of truth for watched state, while Sonarr and Radarr remain the source of truth for media lifecycle.

At a high level it can:

- inspect Plex watch history for episodes and movies
- map Plex items back to Sonarr and Radarr records
- delete or unmonitor matching files when policy allows it
- skip protected content with `safe` and `kids` tags
- perform watched-ahead logic for TV episodes using real user history
- remove items from a Plex watchlist after cleanup
- perform optional Transmission maintenance for stale torrents, failed downloads, and repeated I/O errors
- receive Plex webhook events and optionally act on them in near real time
- send run summaries and health notifications to `ntfy`

## Runtime Modes

There are two supported runtime shapes:

### `job`

The scheduled job runs the full cleanup pass:

- connect to Plex
- load watched episodes and movies
- match content in Sonarr and Radarr
- apply deletion policy
- optionally do Transmission maintenance
- emit a summary line and optional `ntfy` notification

This is the safest default deployment mode and the one most operators should start with.

### `webhook`

The webhook app exposes a Plex webhook endpoint and health endpoint:

- `POST /plex/webhook`
- `GET /healthz`

It can:

- record incoming Plex events
- optionally trigger deletion handling for `media.scrobble`, `media.stop`, and removal-style events
- optionally sync watch state to another Plex server
- expose dependency health for probes and monitoring

The webhook is intentionally opt-in for destructive behavior. Running the webhook does not imply deletions are enabled.

## Architecture

The repository is split into three layers:

- `cleanarr/`
  Shared library code, configuration loading, cleanup logic, and the webhook app implementation.
- `apps/job/`
  Thin entrypoint for the scheduled job image.
- `apps/webhook/`
  Thin entrypoint for the webhook image.

Downstream repos are expected to own:

- Kubernetes manifests and overlays
- secret injection
- ingress, Cloud Run, or service exposure
- image pinning and rollout strategy

### Flow

## Images

- `ghcr.io/<owner>/cleanarr-cronjob`
- `ghcr.io/<owner>/cleanarr-webhook-app`

Release tags follow semver:

- `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- `vMAJOR.MINOR`
- `sha-<commit>`

The Python package version in `pyproject.toml` is the release source of truth.

## Quick Start

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Set the required Plex, Sonarr, and Radarr credentials
3. Start in safe mode with `CLEANARR_DRY_RUN=true`
4. Run the job locally:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
python apps/job/main.py
```

5. Or run the webhook locally:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
python apps/webhook/main.py
```

## Recommended Rollout

For a new deployment:

1. Set `CLEANARR_DRY_RUN=true`
2. Set `CLEANARR_DISABLE_TORRENT_CLEANUP=true` unless you explicitly want Transmission maintenance on day one
3. Run the `job` image first and inspect the summary logs
4. Verify protected items are being skipped as expected
5. Only then disable dry-run
6. Enable `PLEX_WEBHOOK_ENABLE_DELETIONS=true` only if you want event-driven cleanup in addition to the scheduled job
